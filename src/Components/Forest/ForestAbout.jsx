                <h2 className='font-semibold text-xl py-2'>The Problem of Deforestation</h2>
                <p>
                    Deforestation is the process of clearing trees from a large part of the forest for purposes such as farming and construction of buildings. Trees are never re-planted on such a land.

                    Statistics reveal that around half of the forests around the world have been destroyed ever since the evolution of the industrial age. The number is likely to increase in the times to come as industrialists are continually using the forest lands for personal gain. Large number of trees is also cut for producing various goods made from wood and other components of the trees.

                    Deforestation has a negative impact on the environment. Some of the problems it causes are soil erosion, disruption of the water cycle, climate change and loss of biodiversity.

                <p>
                Forests are a boon for the mankind. India especially has been blessed with some of the most beautiful forests that are home for many rarer species of birds and animals. The importance of forests must be recognized and the government must take measures to control the issue of deforestation.
